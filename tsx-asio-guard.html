                            <p>В Cubase 8 были внесены дополнительные оптимизации, увеличен буфер, а технология, соответственно, получила название ASIO Guard. Hey all, Really frustrated and wanted to reach out for some help. I run: Cubase Pro 8.5.20 Windows 7 Pro I7 3770k 3.5ghz MOTU 8pre interface 1 WD 4tb Black (vsts) 1 WD 1tb, 1 Seagate 1 tb. NVIDIA GeForce GTX670 I'm a sound designer and composer that works to video more often than not. The Problem: I have what seem to be random ASIO spikes that clip the meter, video lags and hitches and audio drops out. Soloing certain instruments/audio only makes this worse and Cubase is unsuable. Рекомендуется звуковая карта с ASIO-драйвером для уменьшения задержки  Технология ASIO-Guard призвана уменьшить нагрузку процессора при. I need some advice please. I'm running Cubase 8 Pro on OSX 10.9.5 on a Mac from 2009 which is pretty much maxed out at this point. I record at high sample rates/resolutions and do lots of multi-micing which really adds up in my track count. I also use lots of 3rd party plugins which also add up and by the time my mixes are close to being finished, the ASIO meter is about full and causing audio dropouts here and there. I have played around in settings with things like ASIO guard on/off 7 июл 2013  В седьмой версии добавлена функция предотвращения выпадений ASIO- Guard. Суть ее заключается в том, что все аудиоканалы. I just got Komplete about 2 months ago and while I'm in love with Reaktor, it continues to cut the audio out and crackle when it is armed or monitored. I'm having trouble finding where this bottle neck is happening. My computer is a fully loaded iMac from December 2016: - 4.0 GHz quad-core Intel Core i7 - 16GB 1867MHz DDR3 SDRAM - 512GB Flash Storage - AMD Radeon R9 M395 with 2GB video memory I am running Cubase 8.5 and Reaktor 6 when this happens. It happens through several differe.

So I switched from Cubase 5 on an i7 PC to Artist 7.5 on an 8-core Mac Pro with 32gb of RAM and the performance on the Mac is appalling! Projects that wouldn't touch the sides on the PC are maxing out the Mac, am I doing something wrong? I've heard people mention poor performance with the new Cubase on Xeon processors. Could this be the problem? Although I'm a bit of a Mac noob; I think I've covered everything obvious IE Def running in 64 bit Removed any plugs requiring bridged Cubase Praxis Tipps - Wofür braucht man den ASIO-Guard?

Alright guys, I'm trying to record bass guitar in Cubase and I keep having a issues with the audio quality. If I plug into the audio interface I can play through my monitors without actually starting up a DAW. The quality at this point is great. As soon as I load Cubase and try to monitor the signal it sounds metallic and compressed. There was noticeable latency and disabling ASIO Guard seems to have solved this. I'm not running any VST's, EQ, nothing. I create an empty project, add an audio. Новый звуковой движок Steinberg ASIO-Guard должен улучшить стабильность и исключить выпадение данных. Для поиска неисправностей. After a few minutes of using Retrologue in any project, it will stop playing the first note. Extraordinarily aggravating, because I really like that synth. It happens in exports as well, and my only solution is adding an extra measure, exporting the track solo'd, then bringing it into a new audio track and cropping off the extra bit. Steinberg is taking forever to get back to me, I sent a request three days ago (in the morning) and got a reply this afternoon. Their suggestion was to delete.

Hi there - it was suggested to me that I'd create such a topic to help people who are unsure whether C7 would be right for them or not. People outside the fence, on it or still clinging to it. I have used cubase since 1997 - "went pro" around 2008 Like many people I have also tried just about every DAW application under the sun. Cubase is simply the best fit for me personally. The TL;DR of it is - yes, its a good upgrade from 6.5 and it is worth it. But this thread is for specifics 8 дек 2014  ASIO Guard 2 использует небольшие задержки лишь на треках, где задержки имеют значение, при этом для воспроизводимых треков. Hello guys, I need some help here. Basically I lost the original wav of a composition of mine (I still have the mp3) so I decided to export it once again. I have no idea what am I doing wrong, I set the locators in place, turned off latency compensation, etc. No matter what I do, the exported file is missing some channels that should be there, and some of the ones that work, fade out when they shouldn't. Any ideas? Thanks in advance. Edit: Seems I fixed it by either: Turning 3 дек 2014  Здесь, в 8ом, РЕАЛЬНО стабильно работает на 32, без ASIO GUARD и с ним. При чем теперь, на мой взгляд, стало заметно, есть. Been troubleshooting this for days, currently waiting on my verification e-mail for Cubase forums (which is taking forever) so I figured I'd post here as well to see if anyone was having the same issue. PROBLEM: During playback, Cubase stutters and has audio dropouts, and the problem is present in both Cubase 5 and Cubase 10, so it's not version specific. Happens even when I have a project with only one simple mono audio WAV file. My CPU is not even close to having performance issues. SPECS:.

Hi guys Ive been working on a project for weeks now and suddenly I think the logic file for corrupted the project opens up and after I play and pause the project it crashes extremely frustrated because there was a lot of synth work which I'm unable to recreate. Could you please help me identify the issue. This is the error message if you need any other information please let me know. Process: Logic Pro X \ 2239\ Path: /Applications/Logic The biggest lie that the game of cricket has ever created has to be Mitchell Marsh. Hear me out. In July 1983, when Geoff Marsh's wife, Michelle was pregnant with their soon-to-be-born son Shaun, Geoff was playing cricket with his club. He was batting on 30 when he got a call that his wife had been rushed to the hospital and was going to give birth. Immediately, he retired out on 30, scribbled the location on a piece of paper, and hurried to his car. Since the local stadium at Attadale didn't. I'm not very far into the game, having just gotten to >!Advent!< for the first time, but it's VERY hard to feel what the game whats me to. The beginning of the game tries to set up that Otus is completely terrible at his job, but when we take control of him he's flying well enough to carry other people, at full speed, in combat situations. Then there's the people around Vellie. They all seem to be fairly supportive, if a little skeptical, of Otus' actions when you talk to them.

I also have the 3 basic. Okay, hadn't planned to spend much on the game, but managed to get skinner-boxed. So, I now find myself VIP9, just opened up Sprites at TL48. But I had cracked open an egg before I knew what it was, and now have a Guardian who charges by Tank taking damage, and I run exclusively warriors most of the time. So. I suspect I am doing my team a little bit wrong and may hit a wall in a short while. I hopes of NOT doing that, I'll beg some advice off of you all. I was running Saxar, Orderbreaker.

In 1939 when dictator General Franco took over Spain, there was a migration of over a 100 families from Seville to Dubbo. Finding local timbers too soft for castinets, they fashioned them from wartime soup tins. Flamenco dancing flourished again. My previous post regarding this was quite a long while ago and there's been a lot of changes in the game, so I'm going to post an improved version of my guide here. Feel free to comment if I messed something up or missed something important. --- A BRIEF LOOK AT LATE GAME It takes a lot of soulstones to get any hero to max stars in this game. The break down is as follows: STAR LEVEL 1-2 star: 10 pcs 50k gold (?) 2-3 star: 20 pcs 100k gold (?) 3-4 star: Late 1953?: Contactee George Adamski wrote that “I was visited by three men who direly threatened me, demanding certain papers I had, for one thing. Some of these I gave him, and was promised their return, but this promise was never kept I did not give him some of my important papers. There is no denying that I was frightened. Before they left I was told to stop talking or they would come after me, lock me up and throw the key away.” Keith, Casebook, pp.113-14. 1954?: Maureen Abbot. I am unable to get `simplewallet` to work. I successfully ran `bitmonerod` daemon and and sync'ed the blockchain, and I am also able to run and use `simplewallet`. However, whenever I try the `refresh` command in `simplewallet`, it usually refreshes only several 100,000s blocks, then unpredictably and suddenly crashes with the error description: Abort trap: 6 (Abort trap #6 is the `SIGABRT` signal.) (And on a few other occasions, the `refresh` command simply causes `simplewallet`. My bridge keeps crashing at least 10-15 times a day and is borderline unusable. If anyone can decipher the crash report below that would be amazing. EDIT - I HAVE THE FULL CRASH REPORT, not sure were to post for it to be read.
